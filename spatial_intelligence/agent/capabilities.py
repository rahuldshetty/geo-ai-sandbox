"""Agent capabilities: the harness hooks this app needs.

Both capabilities exist because a tool failure and a provider quirk must not
kill a run. :class:`ToolFailurePolicy` decides what a failing tool call means —
retry it in place when the network blipped, hand the model the error as the
call's result when it did not — and :class:`NormalizeDuplicateToolNames`
normalizes the ``name__name`` alias some compatible models emit before dispatch.

    By default pydantic-ai lets a raised tool exception abort the run, and it
    answers a rejected tool call with a retry prompt charged against the tool's
    retry budget — which, once exhausted, aborts the run too. Neither is right
    here: the tools raise ordinary exceptions for recoverable conditions (bounds
    outside the Web Mercator range, a file too large to read whole, a URL that
    does not resolve), and a model that mistypes an argument has not earned a
    dead prompt.

    So every failure is classified:

    - **transient** (a dropped connection, a timeout, a 5xx) is retried in
      place, with bounded backoff, before the model sees anything — the blip
      costs no round trip and no context;
    - **deterministic** (bad arguments, a missing file, a refused download, a
      sandbox violation) becomes the call's failed result: the model reads the
      reason and adapts in the same run, with no retry and no retry budget
      spent, so it can never exhaust the budget and abort the prompt.

    Argument validation failures are the same thing said earlier: the model gets
    the schema error as the call's result instead of a retry prompt. The retry
    budget is left to pydantic-ai, which only needs it for a call this policy
    never sees — a tool the model is not allowed to call yet.
